# Ticket_Tracker-Full_Stack_Cloud_Application

1. Problem & Solution (Business Impact)--

Many teams face productivity loss and operational risk due to fragmented task tracking, unreliable deployments, and limited visibility into application health. 
This project solves those issues by delivering a production-ready ticket tracking system that centralizes work management while ensuring secure, reliable, and zero-downtime operations. 
Built with a modern frontend and a FastAPI backend backed by a managed PostgreSQL database, the application is containerized and deployed on Azure using automated CI/CD pipelines and Blue/Green deployments. Infrastructure as Code, centralized monitoring, and secure secrets management reduce operational overhead, improve system reliability, and enable safe, repeatable releases at scale.
